# gatsby-starter-etc (pre-alpha)
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) starter that uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a *design system engine* and
[emotion](https://emotion.sh/) as our css-in-js solution, which automatically purges our styles as well.

Site settings, single pages as well as syndicated content (generically called "entries") are retrieved from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)
